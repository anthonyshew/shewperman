## Hello!

My name is Anthony Shew and it is an honor to get to introduce you to my portfolio. I hope that you enjoy it and that you choose to contact me through [my contact form](https://shewperman.dev/contact)!

### The Programmer

 I am a Javascript developer with 4 years of freelance experience creating a number of websites and applications. On every project I have gotten to be a part of, I feel like I have learned something new that I can bring to whatever programming challenges come my way in the future.

What I love about programming is how demanding it can be to both learn and perform in this space. Programming challenges me to reach into the depths of my mind - and in so many directions. Mathematics and logic, certainly. But there's so much more to programming than that. Problem solving. Creativity. Understanding users. Communication. Organization.

All of these points (and many more) must be addressed with high quality in order to create great code and, at the end of a project, a great application. I'm very much a perfectionist so I find that the demands of programming drive me further and further into a passion for this art.

### The Athlete

Well, it's hard for me to ignore the fact that I am a professional athlete. If this is what you know me for and you're surprised to find out about my programming prowess, welcome to this side of my life. ðŸ˜€

My preparation for baseball is largely a part of who I am. I leave no stone unturned. If there is something that can be done to prepare more intelligently, with higher quality, or - well - just better, then you'll find me doing it. I take great pride in the opportunities that I've been afforded in my baseball career thus far and hope that my body of work continues to grow over the coming years.

### The Human Being

Beyond these two major parts of my professional life, there's a lot more that I enjoy. I really like to play guitar. I typically use playing guitar as a way of meditation. If I happen to be feeling some way for the day or just need a break from programming or baseball (as much as I love them, something something "too much of a good thing" something something), playing guitar for a little can release my mind almost immediately. 

I also spend a lot of time with my wife and dog. I absolutely adore my wife and everything she brings to our lives. She is a tremendous worker, a budding special education teacher, and my best friend. Just don't tell our dog, Hazel, because Hazel gets jealous. ðŸ˜€ The three of us spend a lot of time at the dog park, walking, and finding other adventures to em-bark (woof) on.
